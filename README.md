# mern-nlp-project
=======
Overview
This project is a MERN stack website that integrates Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze the sentiment of text using a Flask-based sentiment analysis API 
and stores the results in MongoDB. It consists of a frontend built using React.js and a backend built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. 
The project also includes a Flask-based API for sentiment analysis, which uses a pre-trained model from Hugging Face.

Features
Sentiment Analysis: The backend communicates with a Flask API to process text and return sentiment analysis (positive/negative).
MongoDB Integration: Stores sentiment results along with the corresponding text in a MongoDB database.
Frontend UI: Built with React.js to provide a user-friendly interface for inputting text and displaying sentiment results.
Full MERN Stack: Uses MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js to create a scalable website.
